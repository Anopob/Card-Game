How to deal with damage? This is a big question, dealing with
lots of questions of where to place what since lots of functions
are involved. Take a look for example how to implement something like
Remi's life healing (much harder than Yuugi's damage reduction).

Need a way for spells/creatures to refer to the opponent (unless I'm
supposed to use GAME for that? Which is fine, but I wasn't sure).

I am working on updating both players' interface after spells dealing damage
and so forth, however, I am using a generic "updateCreature" event/socket.
I use this for, well, generic uses, like Konna's "+1 attack after a creature
is damaged" ability because I don't know what else to call it. Feel free to
change it to a better name, however be wary that it is used basically
any time a creature is damaged outside of combat, and thus when stats are
changed outside of combat (eg. Konna again). Also, right now it
still isn't updating correctly (eg. Konna gains attack but it's only shown
for 1 player, the other player still sees default 12) and I'm not sure why.

'updateCreatureStats' is triggered whenever nothing else makes sense, but we
still need to update the creature's stats.
'creatureDamage' is triggered whenever any damage occurs, and ideally should
trigger updateCreatureStats afterwards.

There were quite a few last minute changes so sorry if some stuff don't work.
This is mostly just to show you my code, to make sure I'm on the right track
and ask how we're going to implement certain features in the near-future. So
feel free to not pull code but just make sure you go over what I did so
we can talk about it later. Thanks.

I will be busy for most of the day so hopefully we can discuss some time later.

P.S. "damageRate" can probably just be removed and any time we want to use it,
use "damageToCreatureRate" and "damageToPlayerRate" instead.
