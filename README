The first REAL commit to the card game dev.

Contains:
- A very basic multiplayer demo lacking many game features, using the deck you made in the deck builder
- A deckbuilder that allows you to build decks, saving them locally and sending a copy to the server to save if the deck is valid
- CardUtils.js, a collection of generic utility functions for dealing with cards
- A chat page left as a relic from when this was a chat program.  It probably still works but will need tuning to serve as game chat
- A few images, look in the images folder
- An index page so that the other pages can be found by people
- The server, server.js.  Needs to be running for chat or multiplayer, but deckbuilder should be fine without it. Requires nodejs to run.Navigate a cmd prompt to the directory it's in, and use the command:

        node server.js <port to listen on>

to start it.  Don't forget to port forward if you want others to see it.
